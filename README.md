 <!-- Safe breaking game
 Users input names
A number generates up top above both the users
 there are randonly generated numbers appearing in each players "hand"
if the number up top that is generated, is also in your hand at the moment. 
user is allowed to tap a button
tapping that button adds a tally to your "hand" below the randomly generated numbers that are also in your hand.
get 10 matches/tallies you win
the main number up top will generate evert 10-15 seconds or so 
while the numbers in the players hands will generate every 3-4 seconds

<!-- Splatoon type game
2 players both have empty "hands"
a grid of squares is generated on screen 
both players are prompted to input their names and their square colors
when player two inputs his name the game begins
both players have to click on as many squares on the grid as they can
**might have to take turns bc i don't know how i'd let both players click on the screen at the same time// maybe both players have up down left right and have to highlight the square that they want to click and they click something on their keyboard to register that they've clicked that square and that square turns to their color
when a player clicks on a grid it turns to their color. 
player 1 could be red n player 2 could be blue or something 
i'm not sure if i want the players to be able to take eachother's squares

win condition
game ends when a player has more of their color on the grid than the other player -- 
	rounds
	switching back and forth or not?
	are the rounds timed?

every time a player clicks on a square it turns to their color from white and a number gets added to their 'hand'
when the hand reaches x amount of numbers in it then the program knows the player won
-->
<!--
	users input their names
	once user two inputs their name the game starts
a lot of something(some shape) rise from the bottom of the screen to the top.
both players need to tap as many of those shapes as they can. 
who ever taps the most shapes in x amount of time wins
might have to be done in turns becuase i don't know how i'd make both players be able to click on the screen at the same time
	-->
<!--
both users have a circle that appears on their screen that is falling to the floor
every time a user taps their circle it jumps up in the air
the point of the game is to keep your ball from hitting the floor
everytime a user clicks on a ball, i'd want the ball to 'gain more gravity' or something random that makes the game difficult
